    "Create a program for a hotel booking system. The first line of the program should have a title statement (e.g., “X’s hotel booking system” or something similar). The standard room for a night cost $79.99 (specifically, this would be a constant). The program, however, should accept the user’s input as to the number of nights the user will be staying. Hence, the program would calculate the guest’s hotel cost, which is based on the cost for a night by the number of nights they stay at the hotel. Additionally, users may have one of four membership types: (1) Basic, (2) Advanced, (3) Premium, and (4) VIP. These memberships allow for discounts of 10%, 15%, 25% and 40% respectively. However, not all guests would be members, and thus, would pay the full price."
